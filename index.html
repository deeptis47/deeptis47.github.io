			<font size="+2">The Climate Extremes Lab at Washington State University aims to advance the scientific understanding of extreme weather events that affect communities around the world and how such extremes are affected by the warming our planet is experiencing. Our current focus is on understanding the combination of physical factors that affect heat extremes (hot and cold), drought, heavy precipitation, wildfires, and dry lightning and their impacts on food security, air pollution, human migration, and energy production. In recent years, communities are experiencing multiple such climate hazards either simultaneously or back-to-back and multiple regions are experiencing simultaneous hazards that have compounding and cascading impacts on disaster aid resources, reinsurance industries, supply chains and other interconnected systems. We employ a variety of tools including ground and satellite-based observations, global climate models, household surveys, and socio-economic data in our research. The overall goal of our work is to understand how the risk of these hazards changes from year-to-year and over longer timescales to inform their predictability, societal preparedness and adaptation efforts that could minimize the impacts of such hazards on frontline communities in a changing climate.</font>

                        <h4>TEMPERATURE EXTREMES</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Recent record-breaking heat in the Pacific Northwest, Europe, South Asia and China have cost numerous lives, damaged infrastructure and adversely impacted agriculture and ecosystems. Despite being one of the most widely studied climate hazards, recent heat waves have underscored the complexity of physical factors that contribute to such extremes and raised new scientific questions. Further, the role of humidity in shaping extreme heat impacts is also being increasingly recognized. Our NSF-supported research investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of heat extremes and the influence of natural climate variability on their characteristics. We recently published the first high-resolution, global characterization of the frequency, timing and severity of humid-heat extremes, which we use to understand impacts on agriculture and the health of agricultural workers. We also study concurrent heatwaves - large, simultaneously occurring heat waves across multiple regions in the Northern Hemisphere and recently found that concurrent large heatwaves in the Northern Hemisphere have become 6 times more frequent over the past 4 decades, affecting steadily larger regions with increasing severity. We are currently examining the drivers and characteristics of widespread heatwaves and cold waves in the US and their impacts on the US energy grid.</p>

                        <h4>DROUGHTS</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Droughts can have a range of acute and long-term impacts on human and natural systems including negatively affecting water availability and agricultural production that are critical for the production and consumption of food and the overall health of communities. The historian Mike Davis documented the immense human toll of simultaneous droughts across parts of Asia, Africa and Brazil in the late 19th century in their book Late Victorian Holocausts and the longer-lasting impacts on the creation of a world with massive socioeconomic inequities. Motivated by this work, our research explores the physical drivers of such events in current and warmer climates. Our work revealed that these severe, prolonged droughts in the 1870’s resulted from an unprecedented combination of ocean conditions in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. Examining all such concurrent events in the observed record, we found that while El Niño has the largest influence on concurrent droughts, co-occurrence with natural climate oscillations in other basins result in more widespread and intense concurrent droughts. In a warmer climate, strong El Niño events are projected to become more frequent and combined with the drying effect of a warming climate, they are more likely to produce concurrent droughts, resulting in more frequent and severe concurrent droughts that expose nearly 10 times more people and agricultural areas than in the present climate. Our future work will evaluate the consequences of concurrent droughts on the global food networks.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">The western United States is experiencing larger and more severe wildfires as the climate continues to warm. “Dry” lightning - or lightning occurring with little or no rainfall - ignites many wildfires across this region during the summer since vegetation is usually dry. The combination of drought, heat, and lightning affected California in dramatic fashion during the summer of 2020, when large lightning storms started hundreds of wildfires that burned 2.5 million acres, destroyed numerous homes, and cost 23 human lives. Despite these potentially outsized impacts, the phenomenon of dry lightning has not been extensively studied. Through a NASA-funded project, we aim to investigate the meteorological drivers of dry lightning, the biophysical factors affecting lightning-caused wildfire ignition, and future projections of lightning-caused wildfire risk across the western U.S. in climate models. We recently published the first comprehensive climatology of dry lightning outbreaks in central and northern California, and showed that these outbreaks are caused by four different types of large-scale meteorological patterns each with different spatial patterns of lightning risk - providing useful information for operational forecasting and climate model projections of lightning-caused fires. We are also interested in understanding the impacts of wildfires on air quality and hydrologic hazards. We recently published a study that demonstrates that wildfire smoke and heat are contributing to increases in widespread co-occurrences of multiple harmful air pollutants - particulate matter and surface ozone - over the last two decades. We are currently studying the atmospheric and vegetation conditions that affect lightning-caused wildfire ignitions across the western U.S.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">The South Asian summer monsoon is the predominant source of rainfall for the Indian subcontinent, where nearly 1.8 billion people depend on reliable monsoonal rains for their water resources and food production. A growing portion of the region’s population live below the poverty line and are undernourished, making the region particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change. Nearly every monsoon season in recent years, parts of South Asia have experienced damaging flooding with impacts ranging from immediate loss of lives to the spread of deadly diseases, infrastructure damage, and agricultural losses that have lasting impacts on the food security of communities. Our research focuses on assessing how precipitation patterns associated with the South Asian Monsoons are changing and why. We have shown that extreme rainfall events have become more frequent and intense in parts of the region but there is substantial heterogeneity in observed changes. These observed rainfall changes are shaped by a combination of natural climate variability and multiple human activities including global greenhouse gasses, anthropogenic aerosols (from fossil-fuel and biomass burning), and regional land-surface changes (driven by industrialization and agricultural expansion and intensification). All these factors are going to continue to be important influences on the South Asian monsoon and our work aims to understand their individual and combined influence on the historical and projected trajectory of the monsoons.</p>

                        <h4>CLIMATE IMPACTS ON AGRICULTURE</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Suitable climate conditions are critical for crop growth and some crops are highly sensitive to the exceedance of climate thresholds. The recent occurrence of extremes have affected agriculture in many ways including through temperature, drought or sunburn-driven yield reductions or widespread damages to crops from flooding. For example, the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave resulted in ~60-100% losses in several fruit trees and berries in the region and the 2022 Pakistan floods resulted in losses of ~80% of the expected rice production in certain provinces. We aim to understand the impacts that climate variability and extremes have on crops in different regions. Our current work focuses on understanding the influence of El Nino and Indian Ocean Dipole - two modes of variability that affect the South Asian summer monsoons -  on rice, maize and traditional grains (millets and sorghum) in India. In this project, we also investigate the influence of these modes on the compound extremes that affect these crops. We are also starting a project, working with WA state tree fruit and berry growers, to identify the extreme weather events that affect these crops, characterize near-future probabilities of such extremes and work with WSU extensions to build capacity to integrate extreme weather risk assessment into their programs.</p>

                        <h4>ATMOSPHERIC RIDGES AND EXTREMES</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Large-scale weather patterns have an important influence on surface climate. We study large-scale patterns that are associated with surface climate extremes on various spatial scales such as temperature extremes, heavy precipitation, and droughts. Our work showed that the occurrence of concurrent “warm-West/cool-East” surface temperature extremes, which we referred to as the “North American winter temperature dipole” are associated with anomalous mid-tropospheric ridging over western North America and downstream troughing over eastern North America. Atmospheric ridges are regions of high atmospheric pressure relative to the surroundings that are a key part of the midlatitude atmospheric circulation and are typically associated with warm and dry conditions at the surface. Recent extremes across the western US including the 2021 Pacific Northwest Heatwave and the 2020 Labor Day Fires that burned across Oregon and Washington were associated with ridges. Our recent work found that atmospheric ridges are also responsible for the widespread occurrence of wildfire smoke-related air pollutants across the western U.S. and these ridges are becoming more frequent. Although ridges are widely studied, there are still many unknowns about the atmosphere-ocean-land-surface conditions that affect their characteristics and how they are likely to change with warming. We recently received an NSF grant to advance our basic understanding of the components of the Earth system that influence atmospheric ridges over western North America and investigate how/why ridges respond to climate variability and change, with a particular focus on extreme ridges (very large, very amplified, and/or very persistent ridges). We aim to make the outcomes of this work directly relevant for planning and adaptation. We will be teaming up with the OMSI staff to build tools to educate the community about these important and fascinating atmospheric features.</p>

                        <h4>CLIMATE-DRIVEN MIGRATION</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Climatic changes are threatening reliable access to basic resources like food, water, clean air, and shelter, that are essential for the wellbeing and livelihoods of individuals and communities in many areas. While communities can adapt to some changes that are occurring, events such as destructive wildfires or repeated flooding from sea-level rise challenge the adaptive capacity and have resulted in the displacement of communities. The Pacific Northwest is experiencing migration of individuals and communities due to a range of such climate-driven factors. For instance, multiple tribal communities located near coastal areas are considering or are already in the process of migrating. Further, recent wildfires across the American West have contributed to climate-mobility. In Fall 2022, we received support to build an interdisciplinary framework to understand the physical, socio-economic, and household characteristics that influence migration decisions within and to the Pacific Northwest as well as examine the impacts of migration on vulnerable populations. Understanding and anticipating climate-driven migration can help inform community planning and preparedness as climate extremes become more frequent and severe and acutely affect communities around the world.</p>

</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">
Her work is motivated by the potential for climate science to provide usable information to minimize the risk of climate-related disasters on frontline and overburdened communities around the world. Towards this goal, she studies the physical mechanisms and impacts of individual and compound extremes, and examines the role of human activities in shaping the spatio-temporal patterns of extremes. She is passionate about building a more diverse and inclusive community of researchers and strongly believes that a more diverse community will be more effective in addressing the complex challenges facing the world today. She has developed and engaged in mentoring programs to advance gender and racial diversity at various institutions. She currently co-chairs SOE’s DEI committee and is part of a team funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Foundation to improve transfer pathways from community colleges to 4-year institutions. Outside of work, she enjoys hiking, bike rides, reading, swimming, volunteering at the Blanchet House that serves the houseless community in Portland, animal rescues and other community groups, and engaging with K-12 students and community groups on climate change.

                        <h4>Youth Science Engagement</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Over the years, I have engaged in tutoring and mentoring activities with high-school students through various programs including - the college-bound program of the <b>Boys and Girls Girls Club of the Peninsula </b>(2010-2015), <b>Stanford Medical Youth Program</b> (2011), and the <b>Lamont Secondary School Field Research program </b>(2016). Many of the students I interacted with through these programs became first generation college students. I have also been a panelist for Early Career Researcher panel discussions for high-school groups visiting Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">I enjoy developing hands-on activities get younger students excited about science and engineering. With the <b>Purdue Energy Club</b>, I conducted a number of workshops for students in the Lafayette, Indiana area to educate them about clean energy technologies like solar, wind, and hydro, when I was a graduate student at Purdue (2008-2010). At Stanford, I organized workshops for middle and high-school students during <b>Stanford Splash </b>events. With members of the Women in Earth Sciences group at Stanford, I organized a workshop on Climate Change and Clean Energy for the <b>Girls in Science Day </b>in 2015 organized by the Boys and Girls Club of the Peninsula. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">I gave two talks at the <b>Stanford Science Circle for High-School Students</b> in 2014 with over 50 participants from schools around the Bay Area: <b>Generation Anthropocene: the age of human-induced changes in the Earth System</b> and <b>Indian Summer Monsoon and its Changing Character</b>. With Dr. Diffenbaugh and other graduate students, I was a panelist for the Stanford Continuing Studies Program (2015) widely attended by members of the Bay Area community <b> Earth Matters: A Matter of Degrees</b>. With Daniel Horton, I organized a breakout session at Stanford Connecting the Dots (2014), a popular event for the Stanford and wider community: <b> Weather going wild: Will global warming lead to more extremes? </b>. </p>
